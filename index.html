  <h1>Jason's Blog</h1>
  
  <h2>Week One</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>I think I came up with some solid problems that I feel happy and comfortable to work on, which seems to be all situated around the healthy communities area. Factors that contributed to it was my prior experience in this sort of area. Which made it easier to find problems that I thought were relevant from experience, and just having some knowledge within this area. I didn't finish my Sprint as I had planned, as I'm still recovering from the break and the sickness I had.</p>

  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>The whole week didn't go as I had planned. I was planning to finish all my research and ideation by Thursday to conduct primary research by Friday to give myself adequate time to find insights and to structure my presentation for Wednesday's WIP 1. However, It's looking like I'll have to do my interviews by Monday, and hopefully finish everything throughout the weekends.</p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>Initially, when I did my problem statement ideation, I think I thought too far ahead, I already started to think of solutions, rather than focusing on the root of why this problem happens. Which could've lead me to overlook any potential insights. This reminded me of the 5 Why's design thinking process, which I plan to use throughout my work now.</p>


  <!-- Daily Standup Questions
   What did I accomplish yesterday? 
  What will I do today?
  Are there any blockers? -->

  <h3>Monday</h3>
  <p>I'm writing this retrospectively as I had set up my blog after Monday's class. From memory, I had set up my Github Repository, and deployed my Netlify website, which took a bit as I had troubles setting up Git, and syncing changes from Vs Code to my Github. But eventually it worked. Yesterday I slept early. My blockers are that I was sick on Monday, so I couldn't get help in-person, but I was able to send messages to Simon to help resolve a problem with my Github.</p>

  <h3>Tuesday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I set up my Github and my Netlify Site. Today I worked on the coding bootcamp activity which I just finished just on time. The blockers throughout Tuesday was I was a bit rusty with my coding skills, and I forgot how to implement a mobile side menu using Javascript, but eventually I looked at previous resources and got it figured out.</p>

  <h3>Wednesday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I finished the coding Bootcamp, Wednesday I planned to finish my ideation and get started on secondary research, but was unable too as I didn't feel the best, in the end I only listed some ideas for my problem statement ideation. </p>

  <h3>Thursday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I was unable to do much, but engaged in the group activity using metahpors to create ideas, I started the activity with the ideas I had at the time. Thursday was as productive as Wednesday. Blockers are that I have a lot to catch up on, but I plan to do it on Friday throughout the weekends.</p>

  <h3>Friday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I didn't do much but learnt about enterprises, and that sort of gave me an idea on what sort of approach I would do, social or commercial. Currently, I think I plan to do a social enterprise as I'm likely to target students as my target audience, and usually students want to be efficient with their finances as much as possible. As for Today, I plan to catch up on the work I haven't done throughout the week, and it'll probably last throughout the weekends too.</p>
