  <h1>Jason's Blog</h1>
  
  <h2>Week Two</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>Found some interesting articles from my secondary reserach, and found some potential insights I can work with from doing case studies. I also conducted my interviews and found further insights that will lead me to my solutions. Also had my idea approved by Simon in my WIP 01 Session.</p>

  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>I wouldn't say it didn't go well, but I think my presentations could've been better, as I felt some areas/questions I could've pushed the participant for more details on their responses. However, I'm happy with the insights I have now, just think I could've got a bit more information. Oh yeah, also I made my WIP 01 Slides in 30 minutes before deadline, as I thought the deadline was 11:59pm on Wednesday. </p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>During the interviews, I should've stayed quiet as much as possible, I found myself repeating after the participants, kind of unintentionally giving the signal that I'm satisfied with the answer, even though I would've liked a bit more.</p>


  <!-- Daily Standup Questions
   What did I accomplish yesterday? 
  What will I do today?
  Are there any blockers? -->

  <h3>Monday</h3>
  <p>Monday, I did my case studies and started on my secondary reserach, hoping to either finish today, or ealier tomorrow. The blockers for me were finding relevant secondary research articles, I didn't really had a clear idea on what my secondary reserach should've consisted of.</p>

  <h3>Tuesday</h3>
  <p>Today, I made my interview questions and conducted my interviews, didn't really have any blockers other than I had to do one of my interviews online, instead of in person due to differing schedules with one of my participants.</p>

  <h3>Wednesday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I did my interviews, and today I'm in the process of cleaning up the transcript of my interviews to make it easier to read through each particpants answer to hopefully find some insights or key findings among their responses. I also have to make my WIP slideshow, which could be my blocker as it is due today midnight.</p>

  <h3>Thursday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I submitted my WIP slideshow and cleaned my transcript of my interviews. Today, I hope to finish finding insights from my interview responses, as for blockers, I don't think I have any?</p>

  <h3>Friday</h3>
  <p>Yesterday, I finished finding insights from my interviews. Today, I'll probably work with the feedback I received from my WIP session and explore the AI direction that Simon mentioned for a nutrition app. Blockers is that it's friday night, and I'll probably not do any work knowing me.</p>
