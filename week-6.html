  <h2>Week Six</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>The second WIP session went better than I expected, I did receive feedback on areas I could improve on for my hifi, but I'm happy that my hi-fi prototype actually got the idea across during the WIP session.</p>
 
  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>I think this week didn't really have much problems other than feedback to work towards. Some feedback I received was a contrast problem from using a bright green on a white background, I did know this was a problem, but I took it to the WIP session, to see what my lecturers might say, as the bright green is kind of necessary in my opinion for the aesthetic. Other issues was the amount of text used on a insight section, where it should've been quick summarised information in few sentences, rather than paragraphs. Another feedback I received which I thought was interesting was when scanning a food item, the logging process could be done automatically by using AI to calculate the amount of the food observed. But other than that, not much problems this week. </p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>I think the issues listed above could've been prevented if my hi-fi testing process was a bit more thorough, I didn't really have a research plan for my user testing, rather it was a simple hands-on experience with the prototype to see how the user feels about the app and how they interact with it. While I did ask questions around the area of the insights, I only asked if this was something that was useful or appealing to them, rather than asking how I could've made it better.</p>
