  <h2>Week Four</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>Established a design direction for my brand, and made quick moodboard and stylescapes to help reflect the brand's identity. Also was able to expand upon my brand's idea/solution and goals, which I was happy with, as I felt it definitely had a space in the nutrition app market.</p>

  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>I would like to say some parts of the pitch presentation could've been better, the feedback I received was that it was too wordy and lack of visuals for engagement. I kind of struggled to figure out what I wanted to show and how much I should show, which I believe was the reason the pitch presentation felt wordy and the lack of visuals. I felt every single slide I decided to show was important for the pitch.</p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>During the pitch itself, I could've probably skimmed or summarised some slides, rather than going in-depth to explain them. I should've probably had like a priority list of some slides I did want to go in-depth with, rather treating every single slide equally, as some slides were more important than others to explain the idea, and show why the idea is needed. </p>

  <h3>Retrospective Reflection</h3>
  <p>I believe this week was pretty busy, trying to juggle both branding a bit of the prototype on the side for the pitch presentation for Friday. In the end, I didn't make a paper prototype as the pitch only wanted polished items to show, rather than rough and WIP items. This did make it little bit rough for the future, as I was kind of off track as I haven't done a user testing session yet. 
    <br><br>
    As for the pitch presentation itself, I definitely could've used a priority list when it came to talking about certain slides, and I do remember trying to focus on the storytelling aspect for the pitch, which might've been another factor for why the pitch slides were very wordy.
    <br><br>
    However, I was happy with the idea/solution I came up with for my brand, I thought it felt very strong and had a place in the industry, but it could've been delievered a bit better through the pitch.
