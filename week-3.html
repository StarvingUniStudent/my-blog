  <h2>Week Three</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>I was able to get started and have a somewhat clear direction on my branding and my prototype. Initially, I did some paper prototype to sketch out the layout I thought would work. First I did layout sketches using the experience I have with nutrition apps, then later I referenced existing nutrition apps to help build-up on my existing layout sketches for my prototype. I didn't sketch out all the flows I had in mind as I was focused on working on the branding aspect for this week instead. </p>

  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>I think it was not completely finishing either of the two tasks I started. But, I'm happy that I was able to find a direction to work towards with the branding and prototyping.</p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>Probably, could've just focused on one of the task instead this whole week, rather than both. But I kind of did this just to make sure I have something to work with for next week's pitch presentation.</p>

  <h3>Retrospective Reflection</h3>
  <p>Looking back, working on both the branding and prototyping wasn't the best idea, even though I thought it was during the moment. By working on both, I wasn't able to create a prototype to test on users, as I thought making a paper prototype wasn't top priority at the moment as the pitch presentation wanted 'final' or polished items to show, rather than WIP items.

    As for the branding, it went a bit better, I was able to establish a clear visual direction to work towards for the brand. During this time, I had the concept down, but not the visualisation fully manifested yet. Which can be seen by my initial moodboard and stylescapes.
