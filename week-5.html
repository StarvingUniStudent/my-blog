  <h2>Week Five</h2>
 
  <h3>What Went Well?</h3>
  <p>Improved upon my brand identity and finally have a clear image on what my brand's design will look like. Although, I did get lecturer feedback on my stylescape and logo; which I didn't have at the time. Also did a wireframe/lo-fi user testing, which went well as my participants were easily able to navigate through the app, and able to understand the app's purpose and what makes it different from other nutrition apps.</p>
 
  <h3>What Didn't Go Well</h3>
  <p>Not sure if these count as things not going well but, for my brand identity, I initially had sketches done for a logo, but I wasn't able to ideate a logo that I was happy with, which lead me to stick to a wordmark logo using the font Lato. Which lead me to get feedback from both of my lecturers to explore other options, which I tried to, but still wasn't able to come up with a strong logo idea I was happy with. But, there were some ideas in my sketches that definitely caught my attention, however, I didn't know how to expand on these ideas. Instead, I focused on my prototype/hi-fi for the upcoming WIP session as I only had till next week to showcase my hi-fi prototype.</p>

  <h3>What Can be Improved?</h3>
  <p>I think for my branding, I could've been more thorough when sending through my stylescape and my moodboard to my lecturers. Especially when it came to my moodboard, as I haven't really changed it since I had made the moodboard for the pitch presentation, but I did want their opinion on what I had for my branding at the time to see what they say about my design direction.</p>

  <h3>Retrospective Reflection</h3>
  <p>Looking back, I'm glad I sent my moodboard and stylescape to my lecturers for feedback, as without it, I probably would've stuck to my original logo and typeface, which was using default Lato typeface for my logo. The logo I have now is something I'm happy with, and somehow came about by pure chance.     
    <br><br>
    By using the feedback I was given, my logo ideating process was more intentional by using a logo moodboard as inspiration, and having the opinion of a lecturer guiding a direction to go towards for a logo. However, even with this, I still struggled with coming up and choosing a logo. In the end, I decided to find a rounded geometric font as suggested by Simon, for my logo as my sketches weren't going anywhere. 
    <br><br>
    But by pure chance, I decided to experiment with the typeface of the new font I found, playing around with the shapes of the letters, until I somehow came up with a shape which I thought resemble a leaf, and the letter 'N'. This was when I thought maybe I could turn this into a logo, but before simply sticking with the sole idea I had at the moment, I decided to play around with the shape a bit to see if I can come up with other designs that may be better. But in the end, I stuck with the first iteration as it looked the best.
